MJD Monitor application for Shiny and sql server
created: Johnny Goett goett@lanl.gov

>overview
     This repository contains code for a prototype online analysis engine. The AutoSpec script is run to populate a MySQL database with information of interest. A shiny application then serves this information in various ways to a third party via a web interface. 
	This engine can be used for online monitoring by periodically updating the database tables with subsequent executions of the AutoSpec script at points of interest; for example, when a new ORCAROOT file is loaded to a data directory. 

>requires
     Execution of the AutoSpec script requires a functional installation of MGDO with TAM enabled and GAT.

     This web application runs on R with the Shiny package.
     At a minimum, running this Shiny application will require the following R packages available at R-CRAN
	DBI_0.2-7
	RJSONIO_1.0-3
	caTools_1.14
	httpuv_1.0.6.3
	xtable_1.7-1
	digest_0.6.3
	markdown_0.6.3
	Cairo_1.5-2
	testthat_0.7.1
	bitops_1.0-5
	googleVis_0.4.3

>instructions for running the development server (host=localhost, access to database produced by AutoSpec script)
	1)Open R
	2)$library(shiny)
	3)$runApp("<PATH TO AutoSpec DIRECTORY>")
	Your default web browser should open and display the web application.
